# UltimateStoryteller
This is a quick update of the https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2557208773 mod for 1.4-1.6.

Want to make this harder by adding RNG psycasters (from Vanilla Psycasts Expanded) for your pawns and raids? Check out the Basilicus Patch!: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928443788

=== original description ===
An attempt to combine the best aspects of each storyteller, with some additional aspects:

- Like Randy, events can spawn randomly and in rapid succession.
- Event difficulty is slightly randomized, between 75% and 125% threat points.
- Like Cassandra regular raids are guranteed.
- Like Perry, quests, trading caravans and travelers are much more frequent.
- Population curve is like vanilla. (Though like Randy, population events can still happen through sheer random chance.)

In the end I wanted a storyteller which feels more like an adventure rather than a survival simulator. Could be easier, could be harder, but at the very least something is always happening.

Very simple mod, no scripting nor patching, should be compatible with anything.
